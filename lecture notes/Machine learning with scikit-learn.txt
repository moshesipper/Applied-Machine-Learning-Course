slide 14 -- run code, change to DecisionTree, then Logistic, show predict and predict_proba

slide 19 -- 
   show check_is_fitted source, looks for '_'
   show attributes, e.g., logistic: estimator.classes_, estimator.coef_
   
slide 21 -- plot_cf_matrix.py   

slide 25 -- onehotencoder examples in sklearn

at the end show algspeed, different speeds, also example of uniform way of dealing with algs
